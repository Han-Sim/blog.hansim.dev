# https://blog.hansim.dev

Welcome to my dev blog!

**Source Code**: https://github.com/Han-Sim/blog.hansim.dev

# How did I build this blog?

## Frameworks/libraries

**Serverless**: I used `GatsbyJS` and `GraphQL` instead of using `REST API`

- `GatsbyJS`
- `React`
- `GraphQL`
- `Bootstrap/ReactStrap`

## Key Features

This is a fully featured blog

- Markdown Language | Syntax Highlighting
  - I customized `prism.css` and `markdown.css(GitHub)`
- Recent Post Sections, Tags
  - by `GatsbyJS/GraphQL`
- Comments using Social Media
  - by `DisQus` Plugin
- `SPA` (Single Page Application) supported by `GatsbyJS`
- User-friendly paths(`Post Slug`) to each post
- Responsive design
  - by `Bootstrap` and `ReactStrap`

## Deployment

- **Amazon Web Service: AWS Amplify**
- DNS: **Google Domains**

# Developer's Notes

## June 28, 2019

Finished deploying the final version

- Completed redesigning to achieve modern design
  - Removed 'index' page: **`Post` and `PostList` components are the only pages now!**
  - **No more grid design with Row and Col**: Contents take up the entire screen (reponsive)
  - Warm toned color scheme
- Refactored codes: enhanced readability

Planning to add more features

- Add Cartegories (Tags are messy)
- About (Just a link to https://hansim.dev)
- 'More Postings related to this post' kind of feature
- Search Engine plugin
