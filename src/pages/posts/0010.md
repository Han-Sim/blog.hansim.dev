# So what's `props` and `state` in React?

Simply, **Props** and **State** are two different types of data that controls **component**. 

The biggest difference between props and states is that props is meant to set by its _parents_(or _caller_) and hence the value is fixed and never changed, while state can be changed by `setState()`.

So, if we don't need to change its value over time, just define it as a field on the component instance! State is needed because we need to change its value.

For most of the case, **state** is initialized within `cosntructor()`, which means this will be initialized for the very first phase of its lifecycle hook.

```JavaScript{3}
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { counter: 0 }; //state here
  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); //binding
}
```
