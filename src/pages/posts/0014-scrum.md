# What is Scrum?

**Scrum is an `agile process framework` that is `lightweight` and `iterative`.**

- Scrum is from the idea that **the traditional software development methodology such as `Waterfall` is not suitable since there can be a lot of unpredictable requests from stakeholders.**
- Scrum breaks down the entire big project into smaller pieces that can be done within a short period time. That piece is called `Sprint`. 

# Sprints

Sprint is an software development iteration of few weeks length.

- `Sprint` starts off from the planning phase where a `product owner` populates `product backlogs`, which is about what is needed to be built to improve the product immediately. 
- `Team` works together for implementing these product backlogs and a `Scrum Master` organizes this building process. 
- `Sprint` is done when the product is deliverable and ready to be deployed.

# Why Scrum?

1. Impact is piled up (it grows to be massive changes): each impact that is made by each sprint is piled up and **the total value is growing very fast** because **Scrum encourge daily meeting and feedbacks in order to improve the entire process**. Even though each sprint is just meant to make a small impact, at the end of the day, we can see the huge improvement of the product.
2. Its lightweight which means it can handle fast-paced environment. **Even though it is required to meet all of those different requests from different clients, Scrum guarantess enough flexibility to adjust plans and easily start to develop important things which can make an immediate impact to the product**.
