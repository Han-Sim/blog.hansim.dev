# Yes, `const` cannot be re-assigned or re-declared

**But it doesn't mean that `const` is immutable!** Because `arrays` and `objects` are addressed by reference, they can be modified directly even though they were declared with the `const` keyword.

```JavaScript
const a = { id: 1, name: "han" }
const b = a; // b and a point to the same memory address now.

b.name = 'tom';
console.log(a); // { id: 1, name: 'tom' }
console.log(b); // { id: 1, name: 'tom' }
```

```JavaScript
const a = [4, 2, 3, 1]

b = a // passed by reference: const array/object is MUTABLE!
b.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a - b
})
console.log(a) // [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
// JavaScript does not support Immutability by default!!
```

Immutability has some benefits. For example, in Redux, it is forced to keep the _store_ immutable, because it's simpler and easy to debug as pure functions can be easily tested by units; we can also easily time-travel over the state using git or other dev tools. (There can be more reasons for Redux, such as shallow equality checking which ensure the better performance than deep equality checking; check the official document [here](https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data#what-are-the-benefits-of-immutability) and [this post about redux](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/immutability-in-javascript-using-redux))

Immutability is also a key of **functional programming**. Pure functions do not modify their input or any other global variables. In that sense we can reduce a good amount of possibility to break our applications.

# Then, how we implement immutability in JavaScript

We can use some JavaScript prototype functions that supports immutability. For example, `slice()` returns a copy of the array without changing the original.

```JavaScript{6}
const a = [4, 2, 3, 1]
const c = a.slice(0, 2)
// slice method just returns a slice without modification to the original
// which means we can copy an array in an immutable way

console.log(c) // [ 1, 2 ]
console.log(a) // [ 1, 2, 3, 4]â€ˆ
```

We can also use Array's `map` function. This is a `reducer` example in Redux.

```JavaScript
function reducer(state, action) {
  /*
    State looks like:

    state = [1, 2, "X", 4];
  */

  return state.map((item, index) => {
    // Replace "X" with 3
    // alternatively: you could look for a specific index
    if(item === "X") {
      return 3;
    }

    // Leave every other item unchanged
    return item;
  });
}
```

Also, we can simply add a dependency such as `Immutable.js`.

## Shallow Copy: Spread Operator

Making a shallow copy of an array of object means creating new references to the primitive values inside the object and copying them. A shallow copy refers to the fact that only one level is copied, and that will work fine for an array or object containing only primitive values. Spread Operator is a syntactic sugar to do a shallow copy over values in the arrays/objects. (https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-deep-copy-objects-and-arrays-in-javascript-7c911359b089)

```JavaScript{1}
const d = [...a] // spread operator ---> do a shallow copy over elements in the array
d.push(5)

console.log(a) // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(d) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

When it comes to Object in JS, we have to be careful to use Spread Operator in this case below. If there is another nested object inside the object, only memory address will be copied **because spread syntax is a shallow copy**; it will still refer to the same address.

```JavaScript{7,18-19,21-22}
const state = {
  name: "John Snow",
  occupation: "Lord Commander",
  skills: [],
}

const newState = { ...state, occupation: "King in the north" }
newState.skills.push("fighting")

console.log(state.skills) // [ 'fighting' ]
// However, fighting is added here too!!

// Then, how to update skills[]?
// because array is passed by reference, skills array in 'newState' still refers to the one in state
// we use spread operator again to do a shallow copy

newState.skills=[...newState.skills, "programming"]
newState.skills.push("web development")

console.log(state.skills) // ['fighting']
console.log(newState.skills) // ['fighting', 'programming', 'web development']
```

Before spread syntax, `Object.assign()` had been used. It's not really recommended as using spread syntax is way easy to read.

```JavaScript
const origin = {
  id: 1,
  name: "han"
}
const shallowCopy = Object.assign({}, origin, {name: "ben"}) // the third arg is optional.

console.log(origin) // no changes
console.log(shallowCopy) // name property will be "ben"
```

## Deep Copy: `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` - for nested objects and arrays.

For objects and arrays containing other objects or arrays, copying these objects requires a deep copy. Otherwise, changes made to the nested references will change the data nested in the original object or array. To do deep copy, we can use `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` technique.

```JavaScript
const origin = {
  id: 1,
  name: "han",
  specialties: ["web development", "problem solving"],
}

let deepClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(origin))
deepClone.specialties.push("cooking")

console.log(origin.specialties) // ['web development', 'problem solving']
console.log(deepClone.specialties) // ['web development', 'problem solving', 'cooking']
```

If we know how the object would look like, we can still perform shallow copy on each level of objects and arrays. But if the object is defined during execution, then we should perform deep cloning.

## `Object.freeze()`

We can also use `freeze()` method to occur an error if we try to mutate the specific object.

```JavaScript
const a = [4, 2, 3, 1]

Object.freeze(a)
a.push(5); // error - Cannot add property 4, object is not extensible
console.log(a)
```
